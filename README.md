**This is a very early release of this plugin!**

There are still plenty of bugs a non-implemented features that you may depend
on!

# Nomad Pipeline plugin for Jenkins

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/multani/nomad-pipeline.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/multani/nomad-pipeline)

This is a plugin for Jenkins that runs Jenkins job into the Nomad scheduler, and
allow the configuration of the Nomad jobs from Jenkins pipelines.

Sample job:

```groovy

// Guarantee the node will use this template
def label = "job-${UUID.randomUUID().toString()}"

nomadJobTemplate(label: label) {
    node(label) {
        stage("Run shell command") {
            echo "Hello world!"
        }
    }
}
```

# How to use?

## Jenkins master configuration

You first need to install the plugin.

Then, follow the menu *Jenkins* → *Manage Jenkins* → *Configure System*.

In the *Cloud* section, click on *Add a new cloud* → *Nomad* to configure the
Nomad cloud entry.

![Nomad Plugin configuration](./doc/configuration-screen.png "Nomad Plugin configuration")

You will need to set:

* *Name*: this has to be set to `nomad` for now
* *Nomad URL*: the URL to your Nomad cluster. It has to be reachable from the
  Jenkins master
* *Region*: the default Nomad region you want to launch your job in.
  See [Regions and
  Datacenters](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/internals/architecture.html) in
  the Nomad documentation.
* *Datacenters*: the default Nomad datacenters you want to launch your job in.
  See [Regions and
  Datacenters](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/internals/architecture.html) in
  the Nomad documentation.

You will then be ready to configure and start a new Jenkins job!

### Authentication Token

If your Nomad cluster has ACLs enabled, you can configure the plugin to
authenticate using a dedicated Nomad token.

* The minimum policy needed by the authenticated persona once connected is:

  ```hcl
  namespace "default" {
    capabilities = ["list-jobs", "read-job", "submit-job"]
  }
  ```

* Once the token has been created and associated with this policy, it can be
  saved as a new `Secret text` credentials in Jenkins. The credentials can
  optionaly be associated to the domain of your Nomad cluster.

* Finally, in the plugin configuration panel in *Jenkins* → *Manage Jenkins* →
  *Configure System*, select the correct credentials in the *Nomad Token* select
  box.


## Jenkins jobs configuration

The plugin creates a new Nomad job for each agent started and stops it after each build.

The plugin expects that the agent launched by Nomad will automatically connect
to the Jenkins master via JNLP (see [Distributed
builds](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Distributed+builds)).

For that purpose, the following environment variables are automatically
injected:

* `JENKINS_AGENT_NAME`: the name of the Jenkins agent
* `JENKINS_JNLP_URL`: the URL for Jenkins agent JNLP configuration file
* `JENKINS_SECRET`: the secret key for authentication
* `JENKINS_URL`: the URL to Jenkins web interface

By default if not specified otherwise, the plugin launches the
[jenkins/jnlp-slave](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jnlp-slave) Docker image.

You can set a more complex configuration, as shown below:

```groovy
// Guarantee the node will use this template
def label = "job-${UUID.randomUUID().toString()}"

nomadJobTemplate(
    label: label,
    taskGroups: [
      taskTemplate(
        name: 'jnlp',
        image: 'jenkins/jnlp-slave:alpine',
        resourcesMemory: 2048,
        resourcesCPU: 1000,
        envVars: [
            envVar(key: 'my-super-var', value: '1234'),
            envVar(key: 'OTHER_VAR', value: 'foobar'),
        ],
    )
  ]
) {
    node(label) {
        stage("Run shell command") {
            echo "Hello world!: ${env.OTHER_VAR}"
        }
    }
}
```

# Features

* Specify the Docker image to run your job in your job definition
* Adjust the resources needed in your job definition
* Configure environment variables for your whole job
* Optionally, automatically download the Jenkins agent from the Jenkins master

Current limitations:

* This is a very early version!
* Although it's possible to define multiple tasks within a job, this has not
  been tested yet
* Although it's possible to define multiple Nomad jobs in the same Jenkins
  pipeline, this has not been tested yet.
* It's currently not possible to configure the agent to receive SSH connection
  from the Jenkins master.
* It's not possible to use the plugin using a declarative `Jenkinsfile`
  configuration file (see #2)
* Look at [the issues](https://github.com/multani/nomad-pipeline/issues)!


## List of settings

TODO: complete me!


### `taskTemplate`

This specifies the values for the Nomad job that will be executed:

* `name`: [name of Nomad task
  group](https://nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/group/) to run.

* `image`: [Docker image identifier](https://nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker/#inlinecode-image-16) to start.

  The value undergoes variable names expansion. Jenkins environment variables
  can be specified like this:

  ```groovy
  image: 'img-repo:5003/repo/my-image:${env.BRANCH_NAME}_${env.BUILD_ID}'
  ```

  You can also specify container environment variables:

  ```groovy
  taskGroups: [
    taskTemplate(
      name: 'my-task-grp',
      image: 'img-repo:5003/repo/my-image:${IMAGE_VERSION}'
    )
  ],
  envVars: [
      envVar(key: 'IMAGE_VERSION', value: '0.1')
  ]
  ```

* `resourcesMemory`: [memory
  resources](https://nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/resources/#inlinecode-memory-4)
  allocated for that task.

* `resourcesCPU`: [CPU
  resources](https://nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/resources/#inlinecode-cpu-7)
  allocated for that task.

* `command`: [command to
  execute](https://nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker/#inlinecode-command-9)
  when running the Docker container.

  The value undergoes the same variable names expansion as in the case of the
  `image` setting.

* `args`: [arguments to pass to the
  command](https://nomadproject.io/docs/drivers/docker/#inlinecode-args-13)
  running the Docker container.

  Each argument list entry undergoes the same variable names expansion as in the
  case of the `image` setting.

* `downloadAgentJar`: default to `false`. If set, download the slave agent from
  the Jenkins master at `/jnlpJars/slave.jar` into `/local/slave.jar`, prior to
  start the Nomad job.

  You can then start the worker using the following command:

  ```
  java -jar /local/slave.jar -jnlpUrl $JENKINS_JNLP_URL -secret $JENKINS_SECRET'
  ```



## Migrating from [Nomad Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Nomad+Plugin)

There's another [Jenkins plugin for
Nomad](https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Nomad+Plugin) which has a very
different approach and doesn't support pipeline jobs defintion.

You can still use the same Docker image as you were using with the other
plugin with a few adjustements:

* The other plugin was downloading an agent `jar` file directly from the Jenkins
  master. This is *not done* automatically by default so you need to set
  `downloadAgentJar` to `true` to download it into `/local/slave.jar`.
* The other plugin was starting the Jenkins agent on behalf of the Docker image.

  You will now need to start this agent yourself by setting the right command
  line in the Nomad job.

```groovy
def label = "job-${UUID.randomUUID().toString()}"
nomadJobTemplate(
    label: label,
    taskGroups: [
      taskTemplate(
        name: 'jnlp',
        image: 'your/image', // Your previous Docker image
        // Download the slave agent from the Jenkins master at
        // http://jenkins-master/jnlpJars/slave.jar
        downloadAgentJar: true,
        command: 'sh',
        args: [
          '-c',
          // Start the Jenkins agent:
          //  * /local/slave.jar is automatically downloaded by Nomad from
          //    the Jenkins master
          //  * The JNLP URL and the Jenkins secret is injected by the Jenkins
          //    Nomad plugin.
          'java -jar /local/slave.jar -jnlpUrl $JENKINS_JNLP_URL -secret $JENKINS_SECRET',
        ],
      )
    ]
) {
  // your build here
}
```

## How to build?

```
mvn package
```


## How to run a test environment?

Easy way:

* [download Nomad](https://releases.hashicorp.com/nomad/) and run `nomad agent
  -dev` on your machine (you need Docker also).
* then run: `mvn hpi:run -Djetty.consoleForceReload=false -Djava.util.logging.config.file=debug-plugin-logging.properties`
* wait for Jenkins to start and connect on http://localhost:8080/jenkins/
* create a new pipeline job with the code from `test-config/test.Jenkinsfile`
* configure Jenkins, add a new Cloud Provider and set the Server URL to http://localhost:4646

This plugin is heavily based on the
[kubernetes-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/kubernetes-plugin) - it actually
started as a fork of the Kubernetes code, replaced by calls to the Nomad API.

You may also want to have a look at the
[nomad-plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/nomad-plugin/):

* `nomad-pipeline` allows to define how to run a Jenkins worker directly from a
  `Jenkinsfile` build file, instead of referring to an external definition
  (configured in the Jenkins master). This give much finer grained opportunities
  to control the environment in which the build runs at the expense of
  preventing to have long-running Jenkins worker.
* https://github.com/jenkinsci/nomad-plugin/issues/20 is the initial issue which
  prompted for the creation of `nomad-pipeline`.
